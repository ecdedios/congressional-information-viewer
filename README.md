# Congressional Information Viewer

> The Congressional Information Viewer is a Python desktop application that enables users to explore U.S. Congress members and their legislative activities by state.

The Congressional Information Viewer is a Python-based desktop application that provides users with detailed insights into the activities of U.S. Congress members. Built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, this tool allows users to:

- Select a State: Choose any U.S. state to view its associated congressional representatives.
- View Members of Congress: Display a list of senators and representatives from the selected state, with an option to filter for current members only.
- Explore Sponsored Legislation: For each member, access a comprehensive list of bills they have sponsored or co-sponsored.
- Detailed Bill Information: Dive into specifics of selected bills, including summaries, statuses, and full texts.

The application integrates seamlessly with the Congress.gov API to fetch real-time data. To ensure security, your personal API key is stored securely in a .env file, keeping it hidden from the main application code.

Whether you're a researcher, student, or civically engaged individual, the Congressional Information Viewer offers an intuitive platform to stay informed about legislative activities and your representatives' contributions.
